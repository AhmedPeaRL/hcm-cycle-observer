# hcm-cycle-observer

This repository does not observe in order to act.

It observes because cycles occur,
whether recorded or not.

No outcome depends on this record.
No behavior is triggered.
No optimization is allowed.

This is not a control layer.
This is not feedback.
This is not intelligence.

It is a memory surface
for recurrence without causation.

If cycles repeat,
they repeat on their own terms.
If they do not,
nothing is missing.
